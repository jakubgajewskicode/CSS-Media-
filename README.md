# CSS CASE STUDY

Birds Gallery is on of my first projects where I use:

- CSS media queries @media to my page. (460px to 1200px) You can inspect the page and see that page is responsive on the smallest phones and as well on the bigger screens.
- Flexbox inculding flex-direction / flex-grow / flex-wrap / flex-basis to manage all img files in the right place of the web page
